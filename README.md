## alternatives

[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/applets/113241p-save-the-tweets-you-like-on-twitter-to-a-google-spreadsheet) - however it won't log tweets older than the previous liked tweet (eg: a tweet from 2018 if the last liked tweet was in 2019). I'm assuming it's using the `since_id` filter of the last recorded tweet when calling the [favourites api](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/post-and-engage/api-reference/get-favorites-list).

[dogsheep/twitter-to-sqlite](https://github.com/dogsheep/twitter-to-sqlite) - save favourites (and other things) to sqllite. Has the same API limits of max 3170 tweets at a time.
